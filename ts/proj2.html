                        <div id="1"><strong>Ans1</strong>While COVID-19 can be more dangerous in older people, anyone can get it including young people, some
                          of whom become seriously ill. While we don’t yet fully understand why some people get more serious symptoms, we do know that 
                          young people are more likely to develop serious symptoms if they have certain underlying health conditions, including obesity, 
                          diabetes, cancer or high blood pressure. <br> </div>
                          <br><br><br> 
                         <div id="2">
                             <strong>Ans2:</strong>We are still learning about the risk of developing severe COVID-19 for people living with HIV.
                              Current evidence suggests that people living with HIV have a higher risk, but less so than other health conditions,
                               including obesity, diabetes, severe asthma, heart or lung problems, stroke, dementia or older age.<br> </div>
                               <br><br><br>
                         
                              <div id="3">
                               <strong>Ans3:</strong>Yes. The COVID-19 vaccines currently in use have all been through a rigorous testing and approval procedure to ensure they 
                                 are safe and effective.
                                 As with most vaccines, some people may experience mild symptoms in the days after having a COVID-19 vaccination. This can include a sore arm,
                                  mild fever or generally feeling unwell. A small number of people have had an allergic reaction after being vaccinated,
                                   but this is very rare and can be safely managed.<br> </div>
                                   <br><br><br>
                         
                                   
                               <div id="4">
                                  <strong>Ans4:</strong>There’s currently no evidence that antimalarial drugs can treat or prevent COVID-19.
                                     The main clinical trial trying to find an effective treatment for COVID-19 stopped it’s investigation into the anti-malarial drug,
                                      hydroxychloroquine, in summer 2020. This was after it found no evidence that the drug could prevent people from needing ventilation
                                       or dying, or speed up their recovery.<br> </div>
                                       <br><br><br>
                         
                                       
                                       <div id="5">  
                                         <strong>Ans5:</strong>You can get COVID-19 no matter how sunny and warm it is. Exposing yourself to the sun or high temperatures does
                                          not prevent or treat COVID-19. So, whatever the weather you should follow the official advice to protect yourself from the virus.<br> </div>
                                          <br><br><br>
                         
                                          <div id="6">            
                                          
                                           <strong>Ans6:</strong>There is no drink, hot or cold, that will protect you from coronavirus or cure the illness.
                                              Most people who get COVID-19 recover by themselves. Taking paracetamol, drinking lots of liquids, and getting enough
                                               rest can help you manage your symptoms.<br></div>
                                               <br><br><br>
                                               <div id="7">        
                                                <strong>Ans7:</strong>Drinking alcohol doesn’t cure or prevent COVID-19. In fact, drinking alcohol can weaken your immune system. 
                                                 Drinking high strength ethanol, as found in some cleaning products or hand sanitizers, can be very dangerous.
                                                  You must not consume these products. They will not protect you from COVID-19 and instead drinking these products
                                                   could cause disability or death.<br></div>
